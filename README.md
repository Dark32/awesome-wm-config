awesome-wm-config
=================
My Awesome WM configuration files, made specifically
for Arch Linux, although you can easily use it on any
other distro. It's set up with Awesome & GNOME in mind,
as I use a lot of the GNOME stack.

Setting up
==========
* Clone everything into .config/awesome
* Set up lm_sensors
* Install alsa-utils, compton, i3lock & optionally xorg-xbacklight
* Edit theme.lua, note the icon & wallpaper sections
* You might want to modify the scripts
* Test the scripts that they output the right values
* Modify the rc.lua, it is fairly well commented.
* Enjoy Awesome WM

Modifications
=============
Feel free to use & modify these config files
to your own needs.
